### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was my personal favorite due to how often I played Blackjack when I travel. It feels great to have a better understanding of how the things around you work and this project stimulated that part of my brain perfectly. Of course we only managed to see through a basic part of a Blackjack program but it has spurred my anticipation for a future where I could add graphics and improve upon this foundation to where it is more than just a command line program.

* Lab 9

   Lab 9, part 2 also helped me better understand a type of resource we use practically everyday, a spell checker. These days we all use grammarly or the built in spelling aids that google docs or word provide. The next step after leaarning this in the lab is understanding how you teach a machine grammar and going even further how to interpret the tone of a bit of text.

* Lab 12

   Lab 12 part 1 was a good showcase of the image creating abilities with the Magick::Image library. It shows us the capabilities of computers with simple code. It makes you wonder just how far can you go. During our lectures we were shown a few really good images that could be created with this format and trying to figure out the code and effort behind the images is only more fun when you have tried it out yourself.
